# The Exekias Amphora
The Exekias Amphora website is all about the amphora made by the potter and painter Exekias in the 6th century BC, during the Archaic Period of ancient Greece. More specifically this is the amphora depicting Achilles and Penthesilea, as well as Dionysos and Oinopion.

This website is aimed at individuals who are interested in finding out about ancient artefacts. It provides clear and concise information and presents the sources it was gathered from to allow for more research. Also there is a Feedback section where users can post their criticisms and ideas for the website, as well as a contact section in the footer where all the contact possibilities are listed.

## Testing
<ul>
    <li>I confirmed the header, navigation-bar, amphora section, mythology section, sources section, feedback section and contact section were all readable and easily understandable.</li>
    <li>I have confirmed that the form works, all fields are required before the feedback-form can be submitted and the submit button functions properly.</li>
    <li>I verified that the project is responsive and presentable on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.</li>
    <li>I have confirmed the page works in multiple browsers.</li>
</ul>

### Bugs
#### Fixed Bugs
<ul>
    <li>When first deployed, I noticed a flicker on the right side of the page when set for the smallest screen. I noticed the images had a margin of 10px on every side, additional to the section. I removed them from the class identifier that was designed to create this margin and the issue was resolved.</li>
    <li>During Testing I saw the text area in the feedback-form was automatically set larger by another browser, causing the submit button to be pushed out of the div. I then set the text area to a specific starting size and the issue was resolved.</li>
</ul>

#### Unresolved Bugs
There are no unresolved Bugs.
